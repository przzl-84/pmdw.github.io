          <h4>My Story</h4>
          <p>Hi there! I started <strong>coding</strong> as it seemed like a good route into the digital side of finance. I am now learning about different <em>coding languages</em> and trying to put this new found skill into practice.
          <p>I started by browsing the web looking for online courses in how to learn digital languages and found a really good set of resources, for free, at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">w3schools.com</a>. I eventually found <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> was a great way to learn whenever I wanted because it was an app available on my phone.</p>
